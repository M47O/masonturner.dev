## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vercel, react-icons

## Performance:
100s across the board, baby. This thing is ***FAST***!

Each category received a rating of 100 out of 100.">

## Lessons Learned / Takeaways:

This was my first time building in the Next/Vercel environment. My biggest takeaway is just how optimization-focused Vercel was when creating Next.js. It's unbelievably fast.

Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that deploying a Next app is the easiest deployment process I've encountered yet.
